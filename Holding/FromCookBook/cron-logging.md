title: logging from cron

* Goal: Ship cron logs to logstash.
* Audience: Folks who use cron and want to direct log output somewhere

# preface: email sucks

The most common way I see folks logging from cron is to use the MAILTO= setting
to direct job output to email. Unfortunately, people easily train themselves
and their mail programs to ignore such mail.

You probably to save the logs somewhere so you can debug and analyze them later,
and the best place for that is probably not your inbox.

# using logger, instead

logger is a tool that reads data on standard input. Here's an example use:

    echo "Hello world" | logger -t sample

Logger uses the syslog(3) POSIX api, so your local syslog daemon should pick it
up, and you can usually see the result in /var/log/messages:

    Feb 26 23:07:08 seven sample: Hello world

With this usage in mind, you should see now that you can add '| logger ...' to
your cron jobs and you will get output captured to syslog.

Once you are using the `logger` tool, you can have your local syslog agent
(syslog-ng, etc) ship those logs to logstash directly. Alternately, you can use
logstash's file input to pick this data up from wherever the logs end up (often
/var/log/messages)

# example

For this example, we will be logging output of an old-file cleaner:

    0 0 * * * find /data/cache -print0 -mtime +7 | xargs -0tn100 rm | logger -t "file cleaner"

Because the above uses the '-t' flag on xargs, it will print each command
invoked by xargs which is piped to logger and will be logged.

# caveats

The 'logger' tool that ships with most linux distros will chop messages into
1024-byte lengths. This causes longer messages to be spread across multiple
events. Frankly, this is pretty annoying and makes searching for longer logs
quite difficult.

Additionally, on Linux, syslog(3) writes to /dev/log which is a shared datagram
socket with a limited (but tunable) buffer size. At high log-rates, you *will*
lose events.

If you have short log messages and your system logs at moderate rates or less,
logger is a decent tool for solving this problem.
